
Packages should:

- use model frame
- not coerce data to a data frame (but may use as.list(data))
- residuals, fitted and predict should work with the package
  and the resulting vectors should be named with the row
  number (if they are not provided then dyn may still work
  but then residuals, fitted and predict will not be available)
