
WISHLIST

o vignette

o proj, step, extractAIC, add1, drop1, effects (check whether these work 
  already and if not add dyn methods)

o let lm's used in anova use subset (currently anova takes it over so
  it cannot be used if anova is to be used)

o expand documentation on subsetting (demo/airquality.R for example)

o pass 'call' rather than 'series' data structure from 'model.frame.dyn'

o why do 'nnet::nnet' and 'e1071::svm' not work?

o support for regression functions that do not provide named
  index labels on fitted and resid.

o more testing

o more examples

o timeSeries support (leverage off of zoo)
